Problem Description



It’s an interesting experience to move from ICPC to work, end my college life and start a brand new journey in company.
As is known to all, every stuff in a company has a title, everyone except the boss has a direct leader, and all the relationship forms a tree. If A’s title is higher than B(A is the direct or indirect leader of B), we call it A manages B.
Now, give you the relation of a company, can you calculate how many people manage k people. 
 

Input
There are multiple test cases.
Each test case begins with two integers n and k, n indicates the number of stuff of the company.
Each of the following n-1 lines has two integers A and B, means A is the direct leader of B.

1 <= n <= 100 , 0 <= k < n
1 <= A, B <= n
 

Output
For each test case, output the answer as described above.
 

Sample Input
7 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
 

Sample Output
2



寻找父节点时则把父节点的层数加1

这样ran数组中便可保存其下面有多少人

最后查找ran[i]==k的个数即可


```
#include<stdio.h>
int par[120],ran[120];
void find(int m) {
    if(m!=par[m]) {
        ran[par[m]]++;
        find(par[m]);
    }
}
void unite(int x,int y) {
    if(x!=y)
        par[y]=x;
}
int main() {
    int n,k;
    while(scanf("%d %d",&n,&k)!=EOF) {
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            ran[i]=0;
            par[i]=i;
        }
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            int a,b;
            scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
            unite(a,b);
        }
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)
            find(i);
        int res=0;
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            if(ran[i]==k)
                res++;
        }
        printf("%d\n",res);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
